# Unisynth City

While Unisynth focuses on the Component API, Unisynth City provides APIs that support components with common server-focused features, including the following:
- [routing](/docs/routing/): Define your application routes with directory based routing. (Supports both MPA and SPA routing models.)
- [pages](/docs/pages): Render application pages, the main feature of an application.
- [layouts](/docs/layout/): Define common shared page layouts to be reused across pages.
- [loaders](/docs/route-loader/): Fetch data on the server to be used by the component.
- [actions](/docs/action/): Provide a way for the component to request the server to perform an action.
- [validators](/docs/validator/): Provide a way for validating actions and loaders.
- [endpoints](/docs/endpoints/): A way to define data endpoints for your RESTful API, GraphQL API, JSON, XML or reverse proxy.
- [middleware](/docs/middleware/): A centralized way to perform cross-cutting concerns such as authentication, security, caching, redirects, and logging.
- [server$](/docs/server$/): A simple way to execute logic on the server.
- [cache](/docs/caching/): Control caching of your content.
- [env variables](/docs/guides/env-variables/): API to manage reading environment variables, commonly used for keys, in a platform independent way.
- Supports both Server Side Rendering (SSR) for fully dynamic sites as well as Static Site Generation (SSG) to be hosted on static web servers and CDNs.
- [`vite`](/docs/(unisynth)/advanced/vite/index.mdx#unisynthcity) - entry point  & configuration for Unisynth City.

Unisynth City is a **meta-framework** for Unisynth. Unisynth City is to Unisynth, what [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is to React, [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) is to Vue, [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) to Svelte, and [Analog](https://analogjs.org/) is to Angular.

**Unisynth** (core) and **Unisynth City** (routing) solve problems at two layers of abstraction. **Unisynth**, focuses on component and state management primitives, while **Unisynth City** brings an **opinionated and performant way to build sites at scale**. We don't want to lock the ecosystem into a single correct way of building sites; in fact, we encourage the community to build alternative solutions on top of **Unisynth**.

> While Unisynth City is full of useful functionality, thanks to Unisynth's resumability and JavaScript streaming, there is no additional cost to the end user from Unisynth City. (zero JavaScript).

Use Unisynth City to build an e-commerce website, blog site, or any other website that needs routing, layouts, or data retrieval/updates. Unisynth City is built on Unisynth, and therefore Unisynth City sites are resumable and only download the minimal amount of JavaScript with fine-grained lazy loading.

## Getting Started with Unisynth City

Visit [Create an app using the CLI](/docs/getting-started/#create-an-app-using-the-cli) to see how to create a new Unisynth City starter project. It is as simple as:

<PackageManagerTabs>
<span q:slot="pnpm">
```shell
pnpm create unisynth@latest
```
</span>
<span q:slot="npm">
```shell
npm create unisynth@latest
```
</span>
<span q:slot="yarn">
```shell
yarn create unisynth
```
</span>
<span q:slot="bun">
```shell
bun create unisynth@latest
```
</span>
</PackageManagerTabs>

## High Level API Overview

This table shows which file (`index.tsx` vs `layout.tsx`) the respective feature should be implemented in.

## Partytown

Unisynth City also comes pre-integrated with [Partytown](https://partytown.builder.io) allowing you to execute your third-party code off the main thread.
