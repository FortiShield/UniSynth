# Library

Unisynth uses the [library mode of Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html#library-mode) to create component libraries.

In order to create a component library for Unisynth, you need to make sure of specific rules, this is because the Unisynth Optimizer needs to recognize your library as a Unisynth library.

The easiest way to create a new component library is to use the build-in `library` starter:

<PackageManagerTabs>
<span q:slot="pnpm">
```shell
pnpm create unisynth library my-library
```
</span>
<span q:slot="npm">
```shell
npm create unisynth library my-library
```
</span>
<span q:slot="yarn">
```shell
yarn create unisynth library my-library
```
</span>
<span q:slot="bun">
```shell
bun create unisynth library my-library
```
</span>
</PackageManagerTabs>

This will create a new folder called `my-library` with the following structure:

```bash {2,11,14}
├── README.md
├── package.json
├── src
│   ├── components
│   │   ├── counter
│   │   │   └── counter.tsx
│   │   └── logo
│   │       └── logo.tsx
│   ├── entry.dev.tsx
│   ├── entry.ssr.tsx
│   ├── index.ts
│   └── root.tsx
├── tsconfig.json
└── vite.config.ts
```

The most important files of a library are a properly configured `package.json` and `vite.config.ts`.

## package.json

```json
{
  "name": "my-unisynth-library-name",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "description": "Create a reusable Unisynth component library",
  "main": "./lib/index.unisynth.mjs",
  "unisynth": "./lib/index.unisynth.mjs",
  "types": "./lib-types/index.d.ts",
  "exports": {
    ".": {
      "import": "./lib/index.unisynth.mjs",
      "require": "./lib/index.unisynth.cjs",
      "types": "./lib-types/index.d.ts"
    }
  },
  "files": [
    "lib",
    "lib-types"
  ],
  "type": "module",
}
```

Notice the `unisynth` field, this is the entry point for the Unisynth Optimizer, it will use this file to generate the `index.unisynth.mjs` file.

> The file must be called with the `.unisynth.mjs` extension, otherwise the Unisynth Optimizer will not recognize it.

## vite.config.ts

```ts {8-12}
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import { unisynthVite } from '@khulnasoft.com/unisynth/optimizer';

export default defineConfig(() => {
  return {
    build: {
      target: 'es2020',
      lib: {
        entry: './src/index.ts',
        formats: ['es', 'cjs'],
        fileName: (format) => `index.unisynth.${format === 'es' ? 'mjs' : 'cjs'}`,
      },
    },
    plugins: [unisynthVite()],
  };
});
```

Compared to a normal Vite configuration, libraries will use [the `lib` mode of Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html#library-mode), which requires you to properly configure `build.lib`.

## `src/index.ts`

This is the entry point of your library, it will export all the components, and functions that you want to expose to the world.

```ts
// As an example, we will export the Logo and Counter components
export { Logo } from './components/logo/logo';
export { Counter } from './components/counter/counter';
```

## Libraries are also Apps

The library starter is also a standalone Unisynth app (without routing, nor Unisynth City), this is the reason why you will find `entry.dev.tsx`, `entry.ssr.tsx` and `root.tsx` files.

Do not worry about them, they won't be part of the final library, but they are useful during development and testing, so you can test your components in a real Unisynth app.

## Build and publish

In order to publish your library, you have to first build it in `lib` mode and then publish to npm.

<PackageManagerTabs>
<span q:slot="pnpm">
```shell
pnpm run build
```
</span>
<span q:slot="npm">
```shell
npm run build
```
</span>
<span q:slot="yarn">
```shell
yarn run build
```
</span>
<span q:slot="bun">
```shell
bun run build
```
</span>
</PackageManagerTabs>


This will create a `lib` folder with the following structure. Then you can publish it to npm.

```shell
npm publish
```

> Notice that before first publishing, you might want to update the `package.json` fields, like `name`, `version`, `description`, etc.

> For any other subsequent publish, you will need to update the `version` field.
