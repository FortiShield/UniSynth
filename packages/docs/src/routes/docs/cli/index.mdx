title: CLI - Unisynth
---

# CLI

We currently have two CLI commands: `unisynth build` and `unisynth compile`.

## `unisynth compile`

`unisynth compile` is a relatively straightforward command. It:

- Reads the config in `unisynth.config.js` (also could specify config file by option: `--config=<file>`)
- Receives 1 Unisynth component file as input
- Outputs it to 1 designated target.

You can get more information by running `unisynth --help`

## `unisynth build`

`unisynth build` is meant for entire project/folders, and is therefore more involved. It:

- Reads the config in `unisynth.config.js` (also could specify config file by option: `--config=<file>`)
- Identifies a source folder
- Reads _all_ Unisynth files in the source folder, and
  - Outputs a component for each target in the config or cli options
  - Performs additional transpilation steps on a per-target basis
- Reads _all_ non-Unisynth JS/TS files in the project, and
  - transpiles them as-is to JS
- Performs necessary transformations to both Unisynth & non-Unisynth files so that the output folder is coherent and valid (like renaming all component imports in a Svelte target such that they match the output name, ending in `.svelte`)
