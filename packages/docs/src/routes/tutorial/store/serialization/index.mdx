Stores are serializable as the application is paused on the server and resumed on the client.

Data in a store isn't required to be free of nested references. Unisynth is perfectly happy serializing stores that feature data [cycles](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph).

Stores can also include [Unisynth URLs (QRLs)](../../../docs/(unisynth)/advanced/qrl/index.mdx).

There is no limit to how many stores can be created per component, nor to where they are passed. While the best practice is to implement top-down data flows, Unisynth doesn't require this design philosophy.

> **Your task**: Insert a few items into `parent.children` to create a circular reference between the parent and child stores.

This example also shows how to attach and invoke closures to a store using `$` and `QRL`.
